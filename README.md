# Nicotine+

<img src="pynicotine/gtkgui/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/org.nicotine_plus.Nicotine.svg" align="right" width="128" style="margin: 0 10px">

Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/) peer-to-peer network.

Nicotine+ aims to be a pleasant, free and open source (FOSS) alternative to the official Soulseek client, providing additional functionality while keeping current with the Soulseek protocol.

Nicotine+ uses GTK for its graphical user interface, and is written in Python.

# Download Nicotine+

The current stable version of Nicotine+ is 3.1.1, released on August 2, 2021. See the [release notes](NEWS.md).

## GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris

If you have no need to modify the Nicotine+ source, you are strongly recommended to use packages for your distribution/operating system. This will save you time.

### Ubuntu/Debian (Stable)

To use [stable packages](https://launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/stable) on Ubuntu and Debian, add the stable Nicotine+ apt repository (PPA) by running the following:

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/stable
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6CEB6050A30E5769
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can download one [here](http://ppa.launchpad.net/nicotine-team/stable/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nicotine/). Unlike the repository installation method, Nicotine+ will not update automatically; you need to download a .deb package each time a new release is available.

### Ubuntu/Debian (Unstable)

The project builds [daily unstable snapshots](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+recipe/nicotine+-daily) in a separate [unstable PPA](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/unstable). To use it, run the following:

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/unstable
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6CEB6050A30E5769
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can download one [here](http://ppa.launchpad.net/nicotine-team/unstable/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nicotine/). Unlike the repository installation method, Nicotine+ will not update automatically; you need to download a .deb package each time a new release is available.

### Arch Linux/Manjaro/Parabola (Stable)

Nicotine+ is available in the community repository of Arch Linux, Manjaro and Parabola. To install, run the following:

```sh
sudo pacman -S nicotine+
```

### Void Linux (Stable)

```sh
sudo xbps-install -S nicotine+
```

### Fedora (Stable)

To install Nicotine+ on Fedora, run the following:

### Other Distributions

If Nicotine+ has not been packaged for your distribution/operating system yet, there are other recommended ways of installing Nicotine+.

Keep in mind that Nicotine+ will not update automatically. When a new release is available, run the following:

```sh

```

# Where did the name Nicotine come from?

> I was in a geeky mood and was browsing [http://www.bash.org](http://www.bash.org)'s QDB.  
I stumbled across this quote:  
>> **\<etc>** so tempting to release a product called 'nicotine' and wait for the patches.  
>> **\<etc>** then i would have a reason to only apply one patch a day. otherwise, i'm going against medical advise.  
>
> So I thought what the hell and bluntly stole etc's idea.
