Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) peer-to-peer network.

Nicotine+ aims to be a pleasant, free and open source (FOSS) alternative to the official Soulseek client, providing additional functionality while keeping current with the Soulseek protocol.

Nicotine+ is written in Python and uses GTK for its graphical user interface.

## Where did the name Nicotine come from?

> I was in a geeky mood and was browsing [http://www.bash.org](http://www.bash.org)'s QDB.  
I stumbled across [this quote](http://www.bash.org/?10159):  
>> **\<etc>** so tempting to release a product called 'nicotine' and wait for the patches.  
>> **\<etc>** then i would have a reason to only apply one patch a day. otherwise, i'm going against medical advise.  
>
> So I thought what the hell and bluntly stole etc's idea.
