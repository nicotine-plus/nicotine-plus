from the server are always available if you clear all the search terms.

You can filter by:

- Included text:
      Files are shown if they contain this text.
      Case is insensitive, but word order is important.
      &apos;Spears Brittany&apos; will not show any &apos;Brittany Spears&apos;

- Excluded text:
      As above, but files will not be displayed if the text matches

- Size:
      Shows results based on size. use &gt; and &lt; to find files larger or smaller.
      Files exactly the same as this term will always match.
      Use = to specify an exact match. Use k or m to specify kilo or megabytes.
      &gt;10M will find files larger than 10 megabytes.
      &lt;4000k will find files smaller than 4000k.

- Bitrate:
      Find files based on bitrate. Use &lt; and &gt; to find lower or higher.
      &gt;192 finds 192 and higher, &lt;192 finds 192 or lower.
      =192 only finds 192.
      For VBR, the average bitrate is used.

- Free slot:
      Show only those results from users which have at least
      one upload slot free.

- To set the filter, press Enter. This will apply to any existing results, and any more that are returned.
- To filter in a different way, just set the relevant terms.
- You do not need to do another search to apply a different filter.</property>
