# README Concerning plugins for Nicotine+

## FOR DEVELOPERS

In order to load your own plugins you need to copy them to
~/.local/share/nicotine/plugins, creating this directory if it doesn't exist yet.

There are two kinds of actions you can hook into:

- Events: gives the plugin the ability to alter things. These are time critical, plugins should finish their execution as fast as possible. Let me repeat that: every ms you linger around processing the user will be looking at a frozen Nicotine+.
- Notifications: gives the plugin the ability to respond to things, without being able to alter them. The plugin can take as long as it wants. This is the preferred action to hook into, only use Events if you really have to.

For more help, examine pluginsystem.py and the example plugins. There is no documentation except for existing plugins.
