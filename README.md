Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/)
peer-to-peer network.

Nicotine+ aims to be a lightweight, pleasant, free and open source (FOSS)
alternative to the official Soulseek client, while also providing a
comprehensive set of features.

Nicotine+ is written in Python and uses GTK for its graphical user interface.

## Where did the name Nicotine come from?

> I was in a geeky mood and was browsing bash.org's QDB.  
I stumbled across this quote:  
>> **\<etc>** so tempting to release a product called 'nicotine' and wait for
>> the patches.  
>> **\<etc>** then i would have a reason to only apply one patch a day.
>> otherwise, i'm going against medical advise.  
>
> So I thought what the hell and bluntly stole etc's idea.
