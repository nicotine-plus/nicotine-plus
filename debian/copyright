 Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
 License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
 contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
 acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
 such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
 making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 – Definitions.
 .
 Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
 that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which
 the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
 otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright
 and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
 License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or
 sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed
 Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.  Adapter's
 License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights
 in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms
 and conditions of this Public License.
 BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
 creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as
 essentially the equivalent of this Public License.  Copyright and
 Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
 copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
 recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
 rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License,
 the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
 Similar Rights.
 Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
 absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
 fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
 adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
 Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
 other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
 applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
 Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public
 License are Attribution and ShareAlike.  Licensed Material means the
 artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the
 Licensor applied this Public License.
 Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms
 and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
 Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
 Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.  Licensor means
 the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public
 License.
 Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
 that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as
 reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
 dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
 available to the public including in ways that members of the public may
 access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by
 them.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
 resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
 Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
 amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights
 anywhere in the world.
 You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
 this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
 License grant.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
 non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
 the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in
 whole or in part; and
 produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
 Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
 not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
 Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
 Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
 authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
 modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
 to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
 modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
 technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
 Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
 modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
 Material.  Downstream recipients.
 Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
 Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
 exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
 Public License.  Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.
 Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
 offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted
 Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
 No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
 or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
 Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
 exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
 Material.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
 may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
 Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
 endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
 designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 Other rights.
 .
 Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
 this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
 personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
 and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
 limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
 but not otherwise.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under
 this Public License.
 To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
 royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
 directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
 statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the
 Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
 Attribution.
 .
 If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
 .
 retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
 Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
 Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
 reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
 designated);
 a copyright notice;
 a notice that refers to this Public License;
 a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
 a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
 practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain
 an indication of any previous modifications; and
 indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
 and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
 License.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
 reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You
 Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to
 satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource
 that includes the required information.
 If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
 required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
 ShareAlike.
 In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
 Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
 The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
 the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible
 License.  You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
 Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any
 reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You
 Share Adapted Material.
 You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
 conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted
 Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the
 Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
 for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
 extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
 contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of
 the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis
 Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis
 Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
 You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
 a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the
 avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
 obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
 possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
 as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
 concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,
 or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
 absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
 of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of
 warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not
 apply to You.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be
 liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
 negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
 consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or
 damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
 Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
 such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
 liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
 apply to You.
 The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
 shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
 closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
 This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
 Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
 License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
 automatically.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has
 terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
 automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
 cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express
 reinstatement by the Licensor.
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
 the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this
 Public License.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer
 the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
 distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
 not terminate this Public License.
 Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
 The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
 conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  Any
 arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
 Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the
 terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
 be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
 use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
 permission under this Public License.  To the extent possible, if any
 provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be
 automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
 from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
 remaining terms and conditions.
 No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
 failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
 Licensor.  Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
 interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
 immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
 processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
