# Download Nicotine+

Download stable builds of Nicotine+ for your operating system.

## GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris

If you have no need to modify the Nicotine+ source, you are strongly recommended to use packages for your distribution/operating system. This will save you time.

### Ubuntu/Debian

To use [stable packages](https://launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/stable) on Ubuntu and Debian, add the stable Nicotine+ apt repository (PPA) by running the following:

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/stable
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6CEB6050A30E5769
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can download one [here](http://ppa.launchpad.net/nicotine-team/stable/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nicotine/). Unlike the repository installation method, Nicotine+ will not update automatically; you need to download a .deb package each time a new release is available.

### Fedora

To install Nicotine+ on Fedora, run the following:

```sh
sudo dnf install nicotine+
```

### Flatpak

If your distribution supports Flatpak, you can install Nicotine+ from Flathub.

### FreeBSD
