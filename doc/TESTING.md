# Testing Nicotine+

For those who like living on the bleeding edge, you can run the latest unstable build of Nicotine+ to test recent changes and bug fixes.

If you want to download the current stable version of Nicotine+, see [DOWNLOADS.md](DOWNLOADS.md).

## GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris

### Ubuntu/Debian

The project builds [daily unstable snapshots](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+recipe/nicotine+-daily) in a separate [unstable PPA repository](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/unstable). To install the latest unstable build, run the following:

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/unstable
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6CEB6050A30E5769
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can download one [here](https://nightly.link/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus/workflows/packaging/master/debian-package.zip).

Unlike the repository installation method, Nicotine+ will not update automatically unless you download and install it again.

### Flatpak

Unstable [Flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/setup/) packages are generated after every commit to the master branch, and should only be used for testing.

```

Nicotine+ will now be available in your list of programs.

```console
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus.git
```

To uninstall Nicotine+, run:

### Git

This is not particularly difficult, but may require some [dependancies](DEPENDENCIES.md) to be installed manually.

To run Nicotine+ directly from a local [Git](https://git-scm.com/) folder, run the following:

```console
git clone https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus.git
cd nicotine-plus
./nicotine
```
