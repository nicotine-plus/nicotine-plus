Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/) peer-to-peer network.

Nicotine+ aims to be a pleasant, free and open source (FOSS) alternative to the official Soulseek client, providing additional functionality while keeping current with the Soulseek protocol.

Nicotine+ uses GTK for its graphical user interface, and is written in Python.

# Where did the name Nicotine come from?

> I was in a geeky mood and was browsing [http://www.bash.org](http://www.bash.org)'s QDB.
I stumbled across this quote:
>> **\<etc>** so tempting to release a product called 'nicotine' and wait for the patches.
>> **\<etc>** then i would have a reason to only apply one patch a day. otherwise, i'm going against medical advise.
>
> So I thought what the hell and bluntly stole etc's idea.
