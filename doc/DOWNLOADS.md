To use [stable packages](https://launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/stable) on Ubuntu and Debian, add the *nicotine-team/stable* PPA repository by running the following:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-launchpadlib software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/nicotine-team/stable/ubuntu jammy main'
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can [download one here](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus/releases/latest/download/debian-package.zip).

Unlike the repository installation method, you need to download and install Nicotine+ from the link above every time you want to update to the latest version.

### Flatpak (GNU/Linux)

```sh
pip3 install nicotine-plus
```

Keep in mind that Nicotine+ will not update automatically. When a new release is available, run the following:

```sh
