# Download Nicotine+

## GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris

If you have no need to modify the Nicotine+ source, you are strongly recommended to use packages for your distribution/operating system. This will save you time.

### Ubuntu/Debian (Stable)

To use [stable packages](https://launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/stable) on Ubuntu and Debian, add the stable Nicotine+ apt repository (PPA) by running the following:

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/stable
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6CEB6050A30E5769
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can download one [here](http://ppa.launchpad.net/nicotine-team/stable/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nicotine/). Unlike the repository installation method, Nicotine+ will not update automatically; you need to download a .deb package each time a new release is available.

### Ubuntu/Debian (Unstable)

The project builds [daily unstable snapshots](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+recipe/nicotine+-daily) in a separate [unstable PPA](https://code.launchpad.net/~nicotine-team/+archive/ubuntu/unstable). To use it, run the following:

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nicotine-team/unstable
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6CEB6050A30E5769
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nicotine
```

If you prefer to install a .deb package directly, you can download one [here](http://ppa.launchpad.net/nicotine-team/unstable/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nicotine/). Unlike the repository installation method, Nicotine+ will not update automatically; you need to download a .deb package each time a new release is available.

### Arch Linux/Manjaro/Parabola (Stable)

Nicotine+ is available in the community repository of Arch Linux, Manjaro and Parabola. To install, run the following:

```sh
sudo pacman -S nicotine+
```

### Void Linux (Stable)

To install Nicotine+ on Void Linux, run the following:

```sh
sudo xbps-install -S nicotine+
```

### Fedora (Stable)

To install Nicotine+ on Fedora, run the following:

```sh
sudo dnf install nicotine+
```

### Other Distributions

If Nicotine+ has not been packaged for your distribution/operating system yet, there are other recommended ways of installing Nicotine+.

#### pip (Stable)

Nicotine+ can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). Ensure the [runtime dependencies](doc/DEPENDENCIES.md) are installed, and run the following:

```sh
pip3 install nicotine-plus
```

Keep in mind that Nicotine+ will not update automatically. When a new release is available, run the following:

```sh
pip3 install nicotine-plus --upgrade
```

#### Flatpak (Stable)
