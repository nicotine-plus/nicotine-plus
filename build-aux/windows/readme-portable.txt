While this 'portable' folder is present, Nicotine+ stores user data files in
a 'data' subfolder isolated from the rest of the system.

If you wish to reset the application, only delete the 'data' subfolder. To
disable portable mode and store user data in '%APPDATA%\nicotine' instead,
delete the 'portable' folder.
